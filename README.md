# Movie Ratings UI
This is an example of a Vue.js UI with a Sinatra backend and is still a work in progress. Major features are currently missing. See the TO DO section for more information.

The application is live at: https://movie-ratings-ui.herokuapp.com

The backend API code can be viewed at https://github.com/kelsy/movie-ratings-api

## TO DO:
* Users - Add ability to create a user account and store reviews per user
* Review Updates/Deletion - Add ability to update or delete reviews
* SSL - https does not work currently on heroku deployment
* Add a different favicon XD
